# Music Recommendation System
Basing on the interests of the listener this Unsupervised Machine Learning model recommends music tracks to the user. The main crietrion to know or to draw an assumption on what the user likes are the factors such as his most listened list of tracks' metadata: artist, genre, world-wide reception, popularity and characteristics of the track like temp, bass, acoustiness and many more. 

The data used in the project are exported from the [FMA dataset](https://github.com/mdeff/fma) available on GitHub.
